Tip 1: Learn to say “I Don’t Know”
Tip 2: Have the ability and will to learn
(you DO want to learn and understand what you’re working with; 
I believe that’s the only way of actually doing some progress.)
Tip 3: Keep teaching yourself
(f you don’t stay hungry, 
you’ll never know what you’re missing out on your knowledge and curriculum.
 Look for new stuff and have a reading list. Take notes of everything that seems new 
(but relatable to your area) and prioritize what seems to give you the edge.)
Tip 4: Don’t be a lone wolf
(Allow yourself to open up and make the working environment more friendly towards you.
 It will make things easier 
when you’ll eventually ask for help and it’s just better to get to know people.)
